# AWS's ip-ranges.json

AWS provides a data file showing the current IP ranges their
services use, called [ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json).
You can read more about the file [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).
If you want to look up an IP address, you can see if it's from any of the cloud providers using [this tool](https://cloud-ips.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html).

This repository tracks changes to that file, and based off a trigger on the SNS 
topic automatically produces this chart showing how what percentage of the 
Internet's IPv4 address space AWS is in control of.  Here's some 
more [information about when different regions](announces.md) came 
online, and here's an [animation of the history](https://youtu.be/v__lzuvKxU0) 
of the AWS's IP usage.
